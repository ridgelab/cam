Purpose: Recover a Phylogeny with Codon Aversion and Compare it to The Open Tree of Life.

##########################

REQUIREMENTS:

See requirements in README and README_getOTLtree

##########################

Step 1:
Move all coding sequences (CDS) in FASTA format into a directory, one for each species. 
Each fasta file should be in the format {species_name}{.gz}, with the .gz being used if the file is gzipped.
An example of a directory with correctly formatted CDS files is in the test/mammals/ directory.

Step 2:
Create a Distance Matrix using cam.py
Examples of possible ways to do this are in the README. The recommended method is:
python cam.py -id testFiles/mammals/ -o output

Step 3:
Recover a phylogeny using the distance matrix.
We provide a script to recover a phylogeny using BioPython, makeNewick.py.
python makeNewick.py -i output -o output.nwk

If you are using your own distance matrix in phylip format (instead of CSV format produced by CAM),
specify the -p (phylip) option:
python makeNewick.py -p -i output.phylip -o output.nwk

Step 4:
Infer the phylogeny of these species from the Open Tree of Life.
See README_getOTLtree for more information.
The recommended method is:
python getOTLtree.py -i output.nwk  -o OTL.nwk -e

Step 5:
Compare the recovered phylogeny using cam.py with the Open Tree of Life.
This optional step requires the ETE toolkit (http://etetoolkit.org/download/)
The command we use to compare the trees is:
ete3 compare -t output.nwk -r OTL.nwk --unrooted
The columns with -br+ show the percent similarity between the recovered phylogeny
and the Open Tree of Life.
